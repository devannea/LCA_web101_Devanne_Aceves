            <p>I've re-designed my web page and I am currently working on making sure that the layout looks just as good on mobile devices, as well. My black background is now a gradient one. I've removed the buttons at the top and replaced them with a navigation bar. There are still a couple of bugs that I need to sort out, but I am confident in my ability to prevail.</p>

            <p>I just finished creating my new LinkedIn banner. I feel like it looks a lot better than the previous one. This time I used Adobe Photoshop CC instead of Procreate. I'll add a picture down below, so be sure to take a look!</p>

            <p>My second day of class went well. Now I understand how to share my web page online using Git software. I'm going to update my blog tomorrow. Hopefully all goes well!</p>

            <p>I updated my web page so that the buttons change from gray to white when the cursor hovers over them; I am enjoying using pseudo-classes!</p>
